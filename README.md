# student_performance_estimation
Mini_project aiming to estimate students' performance on end-of-school exam based on historical data.

All the main content and results of this project are in the file "Write_up.ipynb".
Most models (results of which are presented in "Write_up") are trained, tuned and evaluated in "Basic_models.ipynb" and "Models_vardata.ipynb".

The main motivation for answering the question ("how well can we predict end-of-school exam results based on mocks?") was, except for curiosity,
the attempt to equip this years' students with tools to realistically estimate their abilities and hence for them to evaluate how realistic are their
plans to get to the high schools that they intend to get to. And also, to have a good basis for a cool lesson introducing them to Machine Learning.
